22. *Three branches of engineering are listed below. Describe each one briefly and provide two examples of a significant specialized area from each branch:*

### A. Electrical:

Electrical engineering is the industrial-scale engineering for large buildings, or long distance power, or in electronics.

- Electronics Engineering
- Power Systems

### B. Mechanical:

Mechanical Engineering is where you get different physical pieces to move together to perform a function.

- Engine Development
- Robotics (Only on the moving parts, the electrical parts are performed by an electronics engineer).

### C. Industrial

Industrial Engineering is mostly focused on factories where they focus on automation

- Factory automation
- Manufacturing

23. *Name at least three of the five oldest and largest professional engineering organizations "Founder societies":*
**IEEE, ASCE, ?**

24. *Explain briefly the services that are provided by the professional engineering organizations to their members:*

- ASCE: Civil Engineering

a. **568.36**

b. **581.79**

c. **1.28**
26. *Round off the following results to the number of significant figures specified using scientific notation:*
a. **6.6967x10^2**

b. **8x10^-2**

c. **2.66993x10^2**

d. **5.15x10^4**

e. **7.800x10^4**

f. **5.0x10^2**

27. *In the data set below, each measurement was taken of the same dimension:*

mean = **6.2509**

median = **6.2400**

mode = **6.2400**

std = **0.0416**

28. *Use a 99% confidence interval to determine the validity of the 7.22 measurement which appears to be in error:*

```matlab
>> b = [7.22 7.27 7.36 7.23 7.21 7.25 7.26 7.24 7.28 7.24 7.20]

>> B = [7.27 7.36 7.23 7.21 7.25 7.26 7.24 7.28 7.24 7.20]

>> mean(B)+3*std(B)

ans =

    7.3883

>> mean(b)

ans =

    7.2509

>> mean(B)-3*std(B)

ans =

    7.1197

>>
```

**7.22 is within range of the data set, does belong within the set.**
