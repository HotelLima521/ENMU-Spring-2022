# Error in measurements

A common way to examine error is to use percent error.

Percent error = ((deviation from true value) / (True value)) * 100%

**Example**: A 12V battery is measured 11.5V. What is the percent error?

Error = 12-11.5 = 0.5V error

Pe = ((12-11.5) / 12) * 100% = 4.17% deviation

**Example** A 2V battery is measured 1.5V

Error = 2-1.5V

Pe = ((2-1.5) / 2) * 100% = 25% deviation

One way to reduce error is to repeat the measurement average value.

It is proven in statistics that as the number of measurement increases, the average value gets close to the true value. 

Median: We arrange our data in ascending order, the middle value is the median. (odd)

Even: Take either one in the middle, or their average value.

Mode: The measurement that appears most number of times

These three, mean, mode, and median are called the measure of central tendency. These three give us an idea about the reliability of data.

If measurements are accurate, then these three values should be close to each other.

**Example**: 9 technicians measure the thickness of a block. Find mean, mode, and median of data.

1. 0.5871cm
2. 0.5869cm
3. 0.5875cm
4. 0.5874cm
5. 0.5867cm
6. 0.5870cm
7. 0.5871cm
8. 0.5868cm
9. 0.5871cm

Mean = (1:9)/9 = .5871cm

Mode = 0.5871cm

Median: 0.5871cm

Standard Deviation:

The mean, mode, median can be sometimes misleading.

**Example**: pg. 22 of handout, A person designed a bicycle tire that can withstand 100psi someone come and take 6 of the tires to the lab and measure the air pressure in each of report to you the average was 102.

Look at actual data:

1. 160psi
2. 35psi
3. 145psi
4. 60psi
5. 75psi
6. 135psi

We need another tool to measure the variations of measurements.

The denominator is called degree of freedom. n < 30 (samples) we use n-1. If n >= 30, we can use we use either n or n-1.

Measureing of s will provide information about the spread of data.

High S => a wide spread in our data.

Either our measuring technique or our data is questionable.

Variance = S^2

Standard deviation of mean: It is a measure of the spread of the mean or average.
