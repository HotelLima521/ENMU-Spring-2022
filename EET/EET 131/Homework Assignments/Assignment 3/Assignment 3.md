# Contributions of Chinese in Engineering

The Chinese were phenomenal early engineers in a multitude of sectors. The most notable in my opinion would be the invention of gunpowder, which would be chemical engineering. Gunpowder, being used for warfare in 904 AD, and is still used world wide today; albeit in different formulas. Gunpowder greatly influenced the way we perform warfare, removing the need for iron-age weapons.

Speaking of Iron age, the Chinese also invented the casting of Iron, which is also widely used today, especially for industrial grade applications, or my cooking ware (Cast-Iron skillets). My engine blocks in three of my vehicles are also cast-iron, allowing for stronger, higher compression engines allowing for high reliability for high performance in terms of the power output.

Additionally, the Chinese invented paper which greatly increased human knowledge by allowing us to write down the knowledge in our heads instead of on stone tablets. Many books today, including the one I am reading this assignment out of are using paper. 

Lastly, the Chinese invented the manufacturing of textiles.
