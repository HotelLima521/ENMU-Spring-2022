# Chapter 2

## ADD

```as
ADD X0, X1, X2
```

X0 will equal X1+X2, being it is taking the contents of the memory locations of X1 and X2 and placing the sum in X0.
E.g. Assuming X1 = 100 and X2 = 50, X0 will equal 150.

## ADDI

```as
ADD X0, X1, #10
```
X0 will equal X1+10. Basically just appending the sum of the value of X1 with 10 added to it.
